This project is private.

It is adjusted for my own purposes and may require other software that is not available to public.

You are allowed to browse and fork the code and use resulting builds for your own, non commercial, purposes.
However, no further rights (e.g. support or the right to publish your own builds) are granted.


This plugin is for everything I did not want to make a own plugin for.
Also, I sometimes add stuff for testing purpose and remove it later.

It was created for the special needs of the Craftlancer.de Minecraftserver.

This plugin is NOT intended to be released on dev.bukkit.org!
